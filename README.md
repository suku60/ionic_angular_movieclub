# ionic_angular_movieclub

This project was a quick exercise to design an iterface with 3 main tabs: movies, shows, and search. I was requested to use both Ionic Framework and Angular. 
This was my first completely released adaptive project, and I think so far Ionic's features stand out to do things like this.
